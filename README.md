# Portfolio Website
This repository conatins the code that I am actively using for my self-hosted portfolio website, which is constantly under construction. The goal of this repo is to demonstrate the progress I've made on this personally significant project over an extended period of time.

I am currently using HTML, CSS and JavaScript for this website. But may soon recode much of this project using React.
