# Portfolio Website
This repository conatins the code that I am actively using for my self-hosted Frontend Web Developer portfolio website, which is constantly under construction. The goal of this repo is to demonstrate the progress I've made on this personally significant project over an extended period of time.

I am currently using HTML, CSS and JavaScript for this website; along with a number of images. But I may soon recode much of my project using React to improve performance and relevancy.

Everything considered, I am looking to catalog all of the major changes made to my portfolio website by using GitHub. This allows for me to review the transformations this website goes through, of which it has already been through several.
