# Portfolio Website
This repository conatins the code that I am actively using for my self-hosted portfolio website, which is constantly under construction. The goal of this repo is to demonstrate the progress I've made on this personally significant project over time.

I am currently using HTML, CSS and JavaScript for this website.
