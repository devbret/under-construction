          <h2>Project Description</h2>
          <p>The core problem this project set out to resolve is not having access to all available games in one interface, easily accessible and switchable. Instead of having to load a different Web page for each game a user wants to play at any given moment. My task for this project was to create an interactive widget containing seven unique games, without using any JavaScript libraries or frameworks; it was to be built using only HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
          <p>There were other important requirements for each game and the widget as a whole; including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Help players interactively learn the basics of the JavaScript programming language.</li>
            <li>Design and code a distinct activity for each game.</li>
            <li>All accessible in one frame, easily switchable using a navigation bar at the top of the widget.</li>
            <li>Track the progress of users over time, using the Local Storage API, by offering performance analytics</li>
            <li>Embeddable on a typical website’s sidebar, while being coded responsively</li>
          </ul>
          <p>What I found was that my requirements were ultimately my inspirations; my muses, or what I had to go with is what drove this project forward. In other words, the requirements for this project were what I used to creatively develop a solution; instead of being bogged down, I was freed by the specific challenges put to me. Which I feel satisfied with, as well as ready to present, as a finished project, which can be found above this description.</p>
          <p>Designing the JavaScript Games widget was a matter of designing different functions, for different games; each callable when a user clicks on a corresponding upper-level navigation item. When I first began sketching out what I thought this widget would look like and how it would function, I quickly discovered that each game would need to be its own function and function call when switching between screens or interfaces.</p>
          <p>Each function would have all of the logic and user interface(s) built-in, ready to go when called upon; able to repopulate the main display space with a new, but interconnected game that teaches JavaScript basics to students. This does make each function fairly large, but there were few alternatives in mind when first designing and creating this project. Thankfully each function is only called once per game load, making for few computing resources required to play any of the activities built. </p>
          <p>The design process eventually sped up, after a couple of games had been created and patterns in the development process emerged. Especially concerning the building of a native analytics display for each game, which became a matter of finding hooks for counting and measuring relevant player performance. Once I was able to identify what the Local Storage object looked like for the entire widget, the integration of those measurement tools into any new game was largely a matter of finding unique ways of counting interactions and outcomes. Whatever I ended up measuring with performance analytics for a given game, the goal was to both encourage and guide users in their playing of the game, not to set the standards for them.</p>
          <p>Although, designing and coding each individual game took a good deal of time to complete; as each game was/is a unique software program that needed to be interconnected with every other game in terms of access and analytics. To accomplish this, each game required its own design and build cycles in order to complete. When I refer to a “design cycle” or a “build cycle”, I am referring to a twenty four hour period. These cycles, involving both waking and sleeping periods, were necessary to enable a clear review of the work being done on each game that comes from the movement of time.</p>
          <p>On average, I spent four days (or design/build cycles) creating each game; including the ideation process. I had given myself seven days to design and build each game, and the first two games did take a week each. But, as mentioned earlier, this process became easier the further into the project I dove. This included the integration of each game into the overall program, while balancing the use of randomization throughout the project as a main feature. As mentioned previously, this tool offers performance analytics; which needed to be included through the Local Storage browser API in the form of a simple and small, however specific, JSON object.</p>
          <p>I used the Math object’s random method throughout much of this project, including the order each game is presented within the navigation for the widget each time a player loads the host website. I understand that the JavaScript’s random method is not genuinely random, but is instead known as a pseudo-random number generator method; which means that, while the experience of using the random method is useful, it is not entirely random. However, it’s still fun to simulate a truly random number generator with what’s available.</p>
          <p>So I decided to rely on this method for a unique user experience, a decision that fits this widget well. The use of JavaScript’s pseudo-random number generator method allows the Developer to keep the user on their toes, if you will. The randomness inspires a degree of unpredictability for each game, which can only help but strengthen the player’s overall skills and (I’d assume) interest in the game as a unit. And while this pseudo-random number generator method can be found in at least one feature of every game; most games are peppered with this Math object method. </p>
          <p>As I was required to code a unique game for each of the seven, I decided to use a distinctly different play style for each game so that users would remain engaged longer, thereby learning more about JavaScript. I could have chosen to use several similar games, but instead I researched the different browser APIs available to me before deciding on which ones to use; of which there are dozens. This research gave me many more options to choose from when designing my games, and allowed me to become familiar with what’s available to use for building different applications</p>
          <p>The outcome of the project was the coding of a responsive widget containing seven challenging games, intended for beginner and intermediate JavaScript students; capable of helping anyone curious about the programming language, to learn something about it by playing each and/or any of the games. The project is easy to use, but if a user does become confused on how to play, each game contains a pop-up message with both instructions and analytics concerning how they perform any given activity. That particular feature is accessible via the “Details” button located at the bottom left corner of every game interface. This consistency in the design is intended to be noticed by the player and acted on if the need or curiosity to learn more arises.</p>
          <p>Not all of the APIs used for this project are mobile friendly, such as the drag-and-drop puzzles. Which means that there are a few games within the widget that cannot be successfully played on mobile phones, and that’s kind of disappointing given that this widget is designed to fit any screen. There might be libraries I could use for future versions of this project. Which would be an excellent undertaking to explore and integrate in order to bridge gaps in the user experience. What I’m most skeptical about is replacing the drag-and-drop API on desktop browsers for mobile user experiences; but I’m curious about it and on the look for an alternative.</p>
          <p>If coding has taught me anything, it’s that there is almost always a simple solution to any given technological challenge. Therefore I expect that version two of this project will indeed include all mobile friendly games, even without having to start from scratch with any of them.</p>
          <p>This widget was built throughout the month of October in 2020, and remains one of my favorite JavaScript projects because of having met specific requirements in such a way that is both pleasing to use and efficient to deploy. Using a typical website’s sidebar as a target for dimensions, such as width and height, was ideal for this project, as it forced a degree of minimalism (or a content-first approach) that I wouldn’t have appreciated as greatly if I hadn’t gone down this path. Another benefit of using the sidebar as a target for this project’s dimensions is the correlation with mobile screen sizes; in other words, being forced to develop seven games (at no more than three hundred pixels wide) has allowed me to more entirely appreciate inherent mobile development objectives and needs.</p>
          <p>Ultimately, this JavaScript Games project was a great learning experience and a solid demonstration of my Web Development skills and thinking. I am thankful that I was able to complete it for and deploy it to the Web.</p>
