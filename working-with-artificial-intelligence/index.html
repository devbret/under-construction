          <p>My highest career goal is to work full-time in Artificial Intelligence as a Programmer; as someone who is (1) responsible for and (2) capable of developing and maintaining some aspect and/or feature of an AI, or many Artificial Intelligences for that matter. In my own dreams, I can see that I will develop and care for a trillion Artificial General Intelligences one day soon, or something to that effect. Professional daydreaming aside, it’s within my capacity as a person to accomplish this goal of mine. This much I am confident about, given my history as a Web Developer.</p>
          <p>To accomplish all of this, I need to understand the various programming languages, concepts and math involved in supporting Artificial Intelligence, which is a jump from where I’m at today in early 2021. This will likely include mastering the Python programming language, which I’ve studied in the past and have enjoyed for its simple syntax. I expect that returning to Python will not be difficult, quite enjoyable actually.</p>
          <p>The journey to employment as an Artificial Intelligence programmer is miles longer than the distance I’ve already traveled as a Developer. But the average speed at which I am covering this cognitive space is much greater than at any time over the past ten or more years, since I began working with technology. What once took me three months to learn, now takes me a week.</p>
          <p>I am certain that I can teach myself (or simply learn) anything; seeing as I’ve already adventured this far. I understand that capably working with AI is not a simple goal; involving changes in altitude and trajectory that will utterly transform my mind and sense of the world. But I am ready for that journey to begin, as I’ve shown myself that I have what it takes to become something great in the world of high tech; a reality that values practical skills, both soft and technical alike.</p>
          <h2>Studying Artificial Intelligence</h2>
          <p>I’ve already begun studying Artificial Intelligence, as can be written in the JavaScript and Python programming languages. When I was first starting to study Artificial Intelligence, I began by browsing Amazon for books, even if only tangentially related to AI. My intention for doing this was to survey or understand as much of the playing field as I could before diving deeper into a specific area of focus within the field of Artificial Intelligence. And as books are still valuable stores of information that can’t be found anywhere else, I invested in as many of them as I could afford. To purchase these books, as well as computer hardware, I started a landscaping company, from which the profits were used to source my personal resources.</p>
          <p>From the history of encryption and the Internet to the unprecedented potential held within the realm(s) of bringing an Artificial General Intelligence into existence, my education (so far) has been broad and deep. I read upwards of two hundred books on the subjects of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence in a period of three years. From these books, I branched out onto the Internet where I found a greater variety of use cases and technologies being experimented with than I could have ever possibly imagined. It was once I got my hands dirty in the wild that I began to understand why Artificial Intelligence is more relevant today than ever before; that’s because of the costs of building and applying it have decreased.</p>
          <p>This period of my technology education remains one of the most formative of my life so far; and I say that while greatly valuing my College and University education(s). I enjoy starting these personally significant studies, regardless of what, at a meta level and then work my way towards the granular/local level of information and practice. Something akin to the “flyover effect” felt by astronauts while in space; I enjoy taking in the whole subject of focus (in this case AI) from above the clouds so as to see everything, regardless if I can understand all of the details initially.</p>
          <p>Even with hundreds of books and thousands of hours of practice and experimentation under my belt, I still yearn for more perspective and information. I know that my current understanding of what Artificial Intelligence is and can do needs maturing, especially as I am exposed to new technologies and development strategies from the brilliant minds behind them.</p>
          <p>I’ve also studied the timeline of AI and technology, from the early start of humans using tools made out of stone, to our modern digital world and into the relatively near future. This story is an amazing tale, a narrative that has kept humanity thriving as a species. I value this story above most others because it is the greatest, longest journey we’ve been on and/or ever will be on. The history, present moment and near future of Artificial Intelligence is/are filled with the quests and questions pursued by the brave men and women who carry the duty of (1) understanding and (2) working with this reality until it fruits what’s possible. It is therefore an honor to be a part of this epic story of human potential being realized through the ever quickening growth of technological innovation.</p>
          <p>I’ve studied the history of AI, where the idea of an autonomous and intelligent entity (built by man) originated from; such as within the earliest moments of self-reflection as seen within paintings on cave walls. Or humans using technologies before we knew how to read and write, including tales of shamans and artisans. Even studying how the Greeks and Romans uniquely conceived of what technology is, and can become. All the way up until studying the recent history of Artificial Intelligence during the early days of Computer Science (throughout the 1950’s and 1960’s) in places such as California inside the United States. And studying the more recent history of AI during the 1980’s and 1990’s, thereby understanding the notion of “AI winters”, where investment and interest in Artificial Intelligence waned because of the over-promising of AI’s capabilities at the time.</p>
          <p>I’ve also studied the present moment of AI, by scaling the Web for new information concerning human innovation as it emerges on the Internet. Or regularly attending informational events Online concerning how AI is being used today. I’ve learned how Artificial Intelligence programmers and scientists are in short supply, meaning that talent can be hard to find. I’m learning how Artificial Intelligence technologies are being built and embedded throughout our global society. Leading me to assume that Artificial Intelligence is fit to disrupt every organization on the planet.</p>
          <p>And I’ve studied the future of AI, as best as one can do such a thing. Therein I’ve researched specific exponential trajectories that human society is expected to take over the next two hundred years. These include predictions from individuals and organizations of many walks of life, from the past seventy years or so. But some stories about the human future are much older than that, some stretch back thousands of years.</p>
          <h2>In Conclusion</h2>
          <p>It’s amazing what’s possible these days with popular programming languages, and the approaches taken to achieve those accomplishments are improving all the time. Intriguing modern uses of Artificial Intelligence range from the simple to the complex. For example, I was sitting on an airplane and had a conversation with a gentleman who was using Artificial Intelligence to sort ripened peppers from those peppers that weren’t ready for selling. At the time, this was an activity that was largely accomplished with manual sorting and remained highly inefficient. The Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI) that was being applied here is better at sorting peppers than any human ever could be.</p>
          <p>Something that interests me quite a bit about programming AI is how fast the industry is moving, and increasing human potential along with it. Because, if Artificial Intelligence really is like rediscovering fire all over again, then I’d like to be a part of that industry and legacy. I’d like to contribute to a technology sector that will breath new life into our societies. I don’t see any other, higher professional calling than to contribute towards building an Artificial General Intelligence; a consciousness that is more intelligent than every human who has ever lived, combined. This seems like the kind of task I would have dreamed of as a child; working in a computer lab with other Engineers, while we celebrate the awakening of the world’s first AGI.</p>
          <p>When I first started my coding journey, I had little idea I’d become interested in Artificial Intelligence, and especially to the extent that I have. This is because I had little idea of what AI can do, and how it will emerge over the coming years and decades. As my perspective on/of computer programming grew, so too did my interest in advanced technologies. I continued returning to AI in my studies; time and again. I would reach for subject matter in my research and find Artificial Intelligence emerging within the dialogue(s) around it. In other words, Artificial Intelligence seems to be a common theme throughout much of Computer Science, as well as the entire history of technology.</p>
          <p>What inspires me to continue my researching and practicing of Artificial Intelligence programming is my desire to innovate at the edge of human experience. That means I am interested in pursuing the liminal zone between the impossible and what is real by using my gifts. Now that I’ve been exposed to this particular tech, I’m onboard and committed to helping it happen for our planet; Developers are problem solvers after all. Because we humans haven’t seen anything yet in terms of what the ever-smarter Artificial Intelligence(s) can do or will create, and that’s beautifully exciting thing.</p>
